uma abordagem distinta da convencional programa√ß√£o orientada a obejtos para o desenvolvimento de aplica√ßoes e software.\nRessaltando que POO √© bastante util ainda hoje e seu ensino e utilizacao ainda √©  bastante comum atualmente, reafirmamos a sua importancia contudo salientando suas limita√ß√µes. Podemos citar a implantacao do computa√ß√£o paralela utilizando POO tende a ser demasiadamente custosa e dificil, por os estados podem ser alterados bem como sofrer efeitos colaterais.\nEm programa√ß√£o funcional nao sao permitidos mutables.Fun√ß√µes atuam como blocos de constru√ß√£o.\nMesmo javascript nao sendo uma linguagem puramente funcional podemos utilizar alguns principios funcionais no nosso codigo\nDesde o seu surgimento, a programa√ß√£o funcional vem sendo a queridinha dos aficionados pela Ci√™ncia da computa√ß√£o, valorizada pela sua pureza matem√°tica e natureza intrigante, manteve-se escondida em laborat√≥rios de inform√°tica, empoeirados... ocupados por cientistas de dados e PhDs esperan√ßosos. Entretanto, de um tempo para c√°, vem regenerando-se gra√ßas √†s linguagens modernas, como Python, Julia, Ruby, Clojure e - por √∫ltimo mas n√£o menos importante - JavaScipt.\n-- Voc√™ disse, JavaScript? Aquela linguagem de script usada em programa√ß√£o web?\n-- Sim!\nA JavaScript provou ser uma tecnologia importante, e que veio para ficar - por longo tempo. Em grande parte dos casos, isso √© devido ao fato dela poder ser \"renascida\", extendida, com novas estruturas providas por bibliotecas como o Backbone.js, o jQuery, Dojo, underscore.js e tantas mais. Isto est√° intimamente relacionado com a sua identidade como \"linguagem de programa√ß√£o funcional\". Compreendermos a aplica√ß√£o de estruturas e algoritmos provenientes da programa√ß√£o funcional nos ser√° √∫til por longo tempo, independentemente de n√≠vel e/ou habilidades de quem a procura.\n-- Por que devo procur√°-la?\nA programa√ß√£o funcional √© muito poderosa, robusta e elegante; extremamente √∫til para a manipula√ß√£o de grandes estruturas de dados. Podemos obter diversas vantagens com JavaScript ‚Äî uma linguagem de script do lado do cliente - se usada como o meio da aplica√ß√£o do paradigma funcional em tarefas como, respostas ao dom, exibir de forma ordenada a resposta de uma Api e tantas outras das quais precisam os nossos modernos websites.\nNeste livro, aprenderemos grande parte do necess√°rio sobre a programa√ß√£o funcional com JavaScript, a emponderarmos aplica√ß√µes web mediante o uso de \"JavaScript Funcional\", a desbloquear seus poderes secretos permitindo-nos escrever programas mais curtos e poderosos, mais r√°pidos, pois num piscar de olhos s√£o transmitidos pela camada TCP devido ao √≠nfimo tamanho. Veremos a ideia central do paradigma funcional e como aplic√°-lo com o aux√≠lio da JavaScript, um passo-a-passo de problemas e precau√ß√µes que podem surgir, e juntamente, a programa√ß√£o orientada a objetos que ser√° o nosso aux√≠lio - \"aux√≠lio do aux√≠lio\".\nDemonsta√ß√£o\nTalvez seja uma r√°pida demonstra√ß√£o a melhor maneira de iniciarmos com o paradigma funcional. Realizaremos uma s√≥ tarefa de duas maneiras, na primeira utilizaremos os m√©todos j√° existentes no 'Core' e noutra o paradigma funcional. Em seguida, compararemos os dois m√©todos.\nA aplica√ß√£o ‚Äì an e-commerce website\nDigamos que estamos a construir uma aplica√ß√£o do mundo real, um com√©rcio eletr√¥nico para uma empresa de feij√£o e caf√© que tem como objetivo aceitar pedidos por conrrespond√™ncia. Eles vendem caf√© de qualidade e quantidade distintas, acarretando mudan√ßas de pre√ßo.\nMetodos imperativos\nPrimeiramente, vamos conferir o estilo imperativo. Para melhor demonstra√ß√£o, temos de criar objetos que mantenham os dados. Neles podemos buscar valores como se estiv√©ssemos operando no banco de dados; e posteriormente, talvez possamos oper√°-los por l√°. Mas, no momento, assumiremos que s√£o definidos de forma est√°tica.\n// create some objects to store the data\nvar columbian = {\n  name: 'columbian',\n  basePrice: 5\n};\nvar frenchRoast = {\n  name: 'french roast',\n  basePrice: 8\n};\nvar decaf = {\n  name: 'decaf',\n  basePrice: 6\n};\n\n// we'll use a helper function to calculate the cost\n// according to the size and print it to an HTML list\nfunction printPrice( coffee, size ) {\n  if( size == 'small' ) {\n    var price = coffee.basePrice + 2;\n  }\n  else if( size == 'medium' ) {\n    var price = coffee.basePrice + 4;\n  }\n  else {\n    var price = coffee.basePrice + 6\n  }\n\n  // create the new html list item\n  var node = document.createElement( 'li' );\n  var label = coffee.name + ' ' + size;\n  var textnode = document.createTextNode( label + ' price: $'+price );\n  node.appendChild( textnode );\n  document.getElementById( 'products1' ).appendChild( node );\n}\n\n// now all we need to do is call the printPrice function\n// for every sigle combination of coffee type and size\nprintPrice( columbian, 'small' );\nprintPrice( columbian, 'medium' );\nprintPrice( decaf, 'medium' );\n\nNotemos a simplicidade do c√≥digo. E se houvessem mais sabores al√©m dos tr√™s? quem sabe 20, ou talvez 40? Imaginemos ent√£o que se al√©m do tamanho, existisse as op√ß√µes org√¢nico e n√£o org√¢nico. Haja c√≥digo!\nUsando este m√©todo, estamos dizendo √† m√°quina o que imprimir para cada sabor e tamanho. Isso √© o que h√° de pior em c√≥digo imperativo - repeti√ß√£o.\nFunctional programming\nEnquanto no paradigma imperativo dizemos para a m√°quina como ela deve agir para resolver o problema - passo a passo -, no funcional o descrevemos matematicamente para que a m√°quina aja sob ele.\nTomando o princ√≠pio funcional, teremos o mesmo aplicativo com o seguinte c√≥digo:\n// separate the data and logic from the interface\nvar printPrice = function( price, label ) {\n  var node = document.createElement( 'li' );\n  var textnode = document.createTextNode( label + ' price: $' + price );\n  node.appendChild( textnode );\n  document.getElementById( 'products2' ).appendChild( node );\n};\n\n// create function objects for each type of coffee\nvar columbian = function() {\n  this.name = 'columbian';\n  this.basePrice = 5;\n};\nvar frenchRoast = function() {\n  this.name = 'french roast';\n  this.basePrice = 8;\n};\nvar decaf = function() {\n  this.name = 'decaf';\n  this.basePrice = 6;\n};\n\n//create object literals for te different sizes\nvar small = {\n  getPrice : function() { return this.basePrice + 2 },\n  getLabel : function() { return this.name + ' small' }\n};\nvar medium = {\n  getPrice : function() { return this.basePrice + 4 },\n  getLabel : function() { return this.name + ' medium' }\n};\nvar large = {\n  getPrice : function() { return this.basePrice + 6 },\n  getLabel : function() { return this.name + ' large' }\n};\n\n// put all the coffee types and sizes into arrays\nvar coffeeFlavors = [ columbian, frenchRoast, decaf ];\nvar coffeeSizes = [ small, medium, large ];\n\n// build new objects that are combinations of the above\n// and put them into a new array\nvar coffees = coffeeFlavors.reduce( function( previous, current ) {\n  var newCoffee = coffeeSizes.map( function( mixin ) {\n    // `plusmix` function for functional mixins, see Ch.7\n    var newCoffeeObj = plusMixin( current, mixin );\n    return new newCoffeeObj();\n  });\n  return previous.concat( newCoffee );\n}, [] )\n\n// we've now defined how to get the price and label for each\n// coffee flavor and size combination, now we can just print them\ncoffees.forEach( function( coffee ) {\n  printPrice( coffee.getPrice(), coffee.getLabel() );\n})\n\nNos √© evidente que este √© enormemente maior em termos de modularidade. Torna-se agora tarefa simples adicionarmos novos tamanhos e sabores, segue-se abaixo um exemplo:\nvar arabica = function() {\n  this.name = 'arabica',\n  this.basePrice = 11;\n};\n\nvar extraLarge = {\n  getPrice : function() { return this.basePrice + 10 },\n  getLabel : function() { return this.name + ' extra large' }\n};\n\ncoffeeFlavors.push( arabica );\ncoffeeSizes.push( extraLarge );\n\nOs arrays de objetos coffee s√£o \"misturados\" com os de objetos size - com o aux√≠lio da fun√ß√£o plusMixin (consulte o Cap. 7, Programa√ß√£o funcional e orientada a objetos em javascript). As classes de tipo coffee √© quem armazena em vari√°veis o nome do sabor e o pre√ßo padr√£o, as de tipo size cont√™m m√©todos para operarmos com os nomes e pre√ßos. A \"mistura\" acontece dentro de uma opera√ß√£o map(), que aplica uma fun√ß√£o pura em cada elemento do array e retorna uma nova fun√ß√£o dentro da opera√ß√£o reduce() - outra higher order function similar a fun√ß√£o map(), exceto pelo fato dele \"reduzir\" todos os elementos de um Array num s√≥ elemento. E por conseguinte, o novo array contendo todas as combina√ß√µes de tipos e tamanhos √© iterado com o m√©todo forEach(); o forEach() √© outra higher order function que aplica um callback em cada objeto do array. Neste exemplo, fornecemos uma fun√ß√£o an√¥nima que instancia os objetos e chama a fun√ß√£o printPrice() passando os m√©todos getPrice() e getLabel() como argumentos.\nPoder√≠amos ainda, deixar nosso exemplo mais funcional removendo a vari√°vel coffees e fazendo um encadeamento de fun√ß√µes - este √© um poder secreto da programa√ß√£o funcional.\ncoffeeFlavors.reduce( function( previous, current ) {\n  var newCoffee = coffeeSizes.map( function( mixin ) {\n    // `plusMixin` function for functional mixins, see Ch. 7\n    var newCoffeeObj = plusMixin( current, mixin );\n    return new newCoffeeObj();\n  });\n  return previous.concat( newCoffee );\n}, []).forEach(function( coffee ) {\n  printPrice( coffee.getPrice(), coffee.getLabel() );\n})\n\nAl√©m disso, o fluxo de controle n√£o √© \"uma sentada de cima pra baixo\" como aconteceu em nosso c√≥digo imperativo. Na programa√ß√£o funcional, as higher-order functions tomam o lugar dos la√ßos for e while, e, em consequ√™ncia quase ou nenhuma import√¢ncia √© dada quanto a ordem de execu√ß√£o. Iniciantes tedem a tremer quando \"batem o olho\" em c√≥digo quem tem como princ√≠pio o paradigma funcional, no come√ßo pode at√© dar medo, confesso, mas basta um pouco de pr√°tica para pegarmos o jeito - n√£o √© doloroso -, e logo ver√° o qu√£o bom √© c√≥digo funcional.\nEste exemplo n√£o nos apresentou, mas nem de longe, o que a programa√ß√£o funcional com JavaScript tem a oferecer. Veremos exemplos ainda mais poderosos da abordagem funcional.\nFonte\n"},"01-category-theory/01-category-theory.html":{"url":"01-category-theory/01-category-theory.html","title":"Teoria das Categorias","keywords":"","body":"Teoria das Categorias\nTeoria das categorias √© um ramo da matematica abstrata que unifica outros campos da matematica,tal conceito teorico empondera a composi√ß√£o de fun√ß√µes, promove a modularidade, abstra√ß√£o, reusabilidade e componentibilidade de fun√ß√µes por possibilitar dividir problemas grandes em problemas menores.\nUma defini√ß√£o academica de teoria das categorias expressa categorias como uma cole√ß√£o de dados que satisfazem algumas propriedades particulares:\nUma categoria esta sujeita e satisfaz os seguintes axiomas:\n\nUma cole√ß√£o de coisas chamadas de objetos por exemplo A,B,C... variando sobre o objeto.\nUma cole√ß√£o de coisas chamadas morfismos, as vezes chamadas de flechas por padrao f,g,h,... mais tarde Œ±,Œ≤,œÜ,œà,œá variando sobre o morfismo.\nUma rela√ß√£o sobre morfismos e pares de objetos, comumente chamado de digitacao dos morfismos.

que recebe x a qual adiciona x a 1\".\nUma express√£o lambda representa um programa, um algoritmo, um proedimento para produzir um resultado\nConsidere x + y, ela pode ser formalizada na nota√ß√£o matematica casualmente atravez de funcoes de um unico paramento\nf(x) = x + y ou\ng(y) = x + y\nEm javascript:\nconst f =  x -> x + y\nconst g = y -> x + y\n\nExemplo:\nf(0): 0 + y\nf(1): 1 + y\nRepresentacao dessas funcoes na linguagem lambda:\nf = Œªx.x + y\ng = Œªy.x + y\nSendo assim, Œªx.x + y √© equivalenta a fun√ß√£o identidade f(x)=x + y\nE sua aplica√ß√£o:\n(Œªx.x + y)(0) = 0 + y ou\n(Œªx.x + y)(1) = 1 + y.\nAplicando Œªx.x + y no n√∫mero 0 obtemos (Œªx.x + y)(0) (tamb√©m escrito como Œªx.x 0), que resulta na substitui√ß√£o de x para 0 e assim retornando 0 + y, ou y.  \nFuncoes de multiplos paramentos podem ser representados em linguagem lambda como:\nh(x, y) = x + y ou\nk(y, x) = x + y\nE sua aplica√ß√£o:\nh = Œªxy.x + y ou\nk = Œªyx.x + y.\nPor√©m essas funcoes podem ser representadas como fun√ß√µes que retornam outras fun√ß√µes como valores, ja que todo \ncalculo lambda recebe apenas um √∫nico parametro.\nh = Œªx.(Œªy.(x + y))\nEm que ao aplicamos \"a\" temos:\nh(a) = (Œªx.(Œªy.(x + y))(a) \n     = Œªy.(a + y)\nE aplicando o par \"a\" e \"b\" temos:\n(h(a))(b) = ((Œªx.(Œªy.(x + y))(a))(b)\n          = (Œªy.(a + y))(b)\n          = a ‚àí b\n Em javascript podemos representar a aplica√ß√£o parcial de argumentos usando o curry da biblioteca RamdaJS, lembrando que vamos ver mais profundamente sobre currying e ramda com o passar do livro:\nconst h =  curry((x, y) -> x + y)\nh(a)(b) // a + b\n\nExemplo\nPara exemplificar vamos definir duas fun√ß√µes representando True e False, em que a T retorna o seu primeiro valor e F retorna o seu segundo valor\nT ‚â° Œªab.a   F ‚â° Œªab.b\nSendo aplicada parcialmente:\nT ‚â° Œªa.Œªb.a\nEm javascript:\nconst t = curry((a, b) => a)\nconst f = curry((a, b) => b)\nconst display = (boleano) => boleano(true, false)\n\ndisplay(t) //true\ndisplay(f) //false\n\nJ√° conseguimos sinalizar se algo √© verdadeiro ou falso a partir de calculo lambda apenas aplicando a fun√ß√£o display(t) ou display(f).\nNo nosso exemplo, um booleano √© uma fun√ß√£o, mas como fariamos uma nega√ß√£o?\nNOT ‚â° Œªx.xFT\nNOT √© uma fun√ß√£o que recebe um booleano e retorna a aplica√ß√£o do booleano nos

b.\nAND ‚â° Œªab.abF\nOR ‚â° Œªab.aTb.\nconst and = curry((a, b) => a(b , f))\nconst or = curry((a, b) => a(t, b))\n\ndisplay(and(t)(f)) //false\ndisplay(and(t)(t)) //true\ndisplay(or(t)(f)) //true\ndisplay(not(or(t)(f))) // false\ndisplay(not(and(t)(or(t)(f)))) //false\n\nE em Scheme, o dialeto LISP criado por Guy Steele ficamos mais pr√≥ximo ainda da sintaxe do c√°lculo lambda:\n(define

Com ela evitamos o chamado efeito colateral, ou seja, n√£o tocamos em vari√°eis externas nem no estado global. Em outras palavras, ela deve manter tais argumentos intactos. Podemos concluir que: a fun√ß√£o pura apenas retorna valores.\nExemplo disso √© uma fun√ß√£o matem√°tica. A fun√ß√£o Math.sqrt(4) sempre retornar√° 2, n√£o usar√° nenhuma informa√ß√£o \"obscura\", como configura√ß√µes ou estado, e nunca causar√° efeitos colaterais.\nPodemos dizer que uma fun√ß√£o pura corresponde ao termo 'fun√ß√£o matem√°tica'; O Amor Uno entre a entrada e a sa√≠da.

E tal comportamento - que da pure function prov√©m - permite-nos exibir a mensagem em qualquer posi√ß√£o, tornando-a muito vers√°til.\nTendemos a pensar que a fun√ß√£o non-pure seja melhor devido a ela ter adicionado[appendChild] o elemento [elem] em vez de retorn√°-lo, entretanto, a fun√ß√£o printSomewhere() est√° mais apta a encaixar-se nas t√©cnias da programa√ß√£o funcional.\nvar messages = [ 'Leibniz', '1646', 'fun√ß√£o', 'matem√°tica' ];\nmessages.map( function( s, i ) {\n  return printSomewhere( s, 100 * i * 10, 10 * i * 10 );\n}).forEach( function( element ) {\n  document.body.appendChild( element );\n});\n\nQuando as fun√ß√µes s√£o puras, ou seja, independentes de estado ou do ambiente, n√£o precisamos dar a m√≠nima import√¢ncia para quando ou onde elas ser√£o computadas.

Isso √© o que chamamos de \"Currying\", palavra que veio do Haskell Curry, um matematico que foi de grande influencia no desenvolvimento de linguagens funcionais.\nPor√©m, quando usamos multiplos argumentos no js temos algo parecido com isso:\nconst add = (x, y) =>  x + y\nadd(1) //NaN\nadd(1, 1) //2\n\nPara simularmos um currying no javascript podemos fazer algo assim:\nconst h =  x => y => x + y\n}\nadd(a)(b) // a + b\n\nNesse caso estamos retornar uma sub-fun√ß√£o dentro de uma fun√ß√£o para podermos resolver o x + y passando um parametro por vez.\nTanto que, quanto tentamos aplicar apenas um dos argumentos, n√£o recebemos um NaN mas sim uma fun√ß√£o esperando o proximo argumento.\nadd(a) // y => a + y\n\nSupondo que vamos receber v√°rios argumentos na nossa fun√ß√£o, nesse caso teremos que retornar fun√ß√µes que retornar fun√ß√µes que retornam fun√ß√µes. \nconst addThree =  x => y => z => x + y + z\n}\naddThree(a)(b)(c) // a + b + c\n\nCompiladores de linguagens funcionais como haskell interpretam apenas um argumento por vez, ent√£o por mais que voc√™ coloque os argumentos como add(1,2) ele j√° faz o pr√≥prio curry por padr√£oe portanto a aplica√ß√£o parcial de um add(1)(2) da mesma fun√ß√£o seria aceita sem problemas.\nUm exemplo disso √© assinatura das fun√ß√µes em Haskell, uma fun√ß√£o como a fun√ß√£o abaixo teria a seguinte assinatura:\naddThree :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int  \naddThree x y z = x + y + z\n\nEm que representa os argumentos que ser√£o recebidos em ordem e o retorno esperado da fun√ß√£o, no caso um inteiro com a soma dos argumentos.\nIsso vem do fato que haskell teve suas bases no calculo lambda em que apenas um argumento √© aceito por fun√ß√£o, veremos mais sobre isso no capitulo de calculo lambda.\nPara facilitar o processo e simular o que linguagens funcionais fazem, podemos usar o curry da biblioteca RamdaJS tamb√©m para resolver nosso problema de forma semantica:\nconst add =  curry((x, y) -> x + y)\nadd(a)(b) // a + b\n\nQuando fazemos 1 + 1 no javascript esta opera√ß√£o binaria tem dois parametros, em linguagens funcionais o operador + geralmente funciona como a fun√ß√£o que criamos agora. Ou seja, quando voce escreve x + y o compilador reescreve o codigo transforma o calculo em infixo ((+) x y), em que a fun√ß√£o + chama dois parametros.\nPartial Application\nNotamos que fun√ß√µes com multiplos parametros podem ser quebrados em fun√ß√µes com parametros menores e √© a forma matematica de se fazer isso mas isso nos leva a outra tecnica chamada Aplica√ß√£o parcial e tem uma diferen√ßa tenua do Curry.\nconst add = (a, b) =>\n    (b === undefined) ?

Aridade √© o numero de argumento que a nossa fun√ß√£o espera para sabermos quando devemos parar de retornar fun√ß√µes e retornar um valor. Para implementarmos nosso curry temos de primeiro saber a aridade de nossa fun√ß√£o\nconst arity = fn => return fn.length\nconst add => (x, y) => x + y\n\narity(add) //2\n\nNote que a fun√ß√£o add que soma dois numeros tem um valor aridade igual a 2.\nconst arity = fn => fn.length\n\nPara implementarmos uma fun√ß√£o de curry vamos precisar saber qual a aridade da fun√ß√£o e pra isso vamos reutilizar a fun√ß√£o arity.\nContinuando a logica, vamos ent√£o criar uma fun√ß√£o curry e fazer com que ela chame uma uma nova fun√ß√£o chamada curried que vai ser nossa fun√ß√£o \"\"curriada\"\".\nconst curry = (fn) => {\n    return const curried = () => \"Curry com batata\"\n}\n\nAssim:\nconst add = (x, y) => x + y\ncurry(add) //[Function]\ncurry(add)(1) //\"Curry com batata\" \ncurry(add)(1)(2) //TypeError: curry(...)(...) is not a function\n\nPara considerarmos mais de um argumento podemos ent√£o receber os argumentos da primeira fun√ß√£o e passar como argumento para nossa curried. Alcan√ßou a aridade a fun√ß√£o √© chamada caso contrario a fun√ß√£o curried √© chamada novamente com os argumentos remanescentes.\nconst curry = (fn, ...args) => {\n  return const curried = (...args) => {\n      return args.length >= arity(fn) ?\n        fn.call(this, ...args) :\n        (...rest) =>  curried.call(this, ...args, ...rest);\n  }\n}\n\nTestando temos o esperado:\n\n```javascript\nconst add = (x, y) => x + y\n\nconst curriedAdd = curry(add)\nconst addTwo = add(2)\nadd2(2) //4\n\n"},"07-composition-and-pipelines/07-composition-and-pipelines.html":{"url":"07-composition-and-pipelines/07-composition-and-pipelines.html","title":"Composi√ß√£o e pipeline","keywords":"","body":"Sequential Pattern Strategy\nQuando falamos de paradigmas de programa√ß√£o diferentes tamb√©m falamos de formar de modelar e pensar em problemas diferentes. \nEm linguagens procedurais nossas computa√ß√µes envolvem nosso c√≥digo separado em modulos operando em dados.
